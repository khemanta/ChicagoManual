  abstract = {Environmental stresses converge on the mitochondria that can trigger
	or inhibit cell death. Excitable, postmitotic cells, in response
	to sublethal noxious stress, engage mechanisms that afford protection
	from subsequent insults. We show that reoxygenation after prolonged
	hypoxia reduces the reactive oxygen species (ROS) threshold for the
	mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) in cardiomyocytes and
	that cell survival is steeply negatively correlated with the fraction
	of depolarized mitochondria. Cell protection that exhibits a memory
	(preconditioning) results from triggered mitochondrial swelling that
	causes enhanced substrate oxidation and ROS production, leading to
	redox activation of PKC, which inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3beta
	(GSK-3beta). Alternatively, receptor tyrosine kinase or certain G
	protein-coupled receptor activation elicits cell protection (without
	mitochondrial swelling or durable memory) by inhibiting GSK-3beta,
	via protein kinase B/Akt and mTOR/p70(s6k) pathways, PKC pathways,
	or protein kinase A pathways. The convergence of these pathways via
	inhibition of GSK-3beta on the end effector, the permeability transition
	pore complex, to limit MPT induction is the general mechanism of
	cardiomyocyte protection.},

	of the fluid phase of the cytoplasm and the screening effect due

	x {(D/D(w))(filament} screening). The equation {(D/D(w))filament}

	fringe pattern photobleaching {(MFPP)} was used to measure the translational
	diffusion of microinjected fluorescein isothiocyanate {(FITC)-labeled}
	proteins of different sizes in the cytoplasm of cultured muscle cells.
	This technique, which is an extension of the classical fluorescence
	recovery after photobleaching {(FRAP)} technique, allows the measurement
	of the translational diffusion of macromolecules over several microns.
	Proteins used had molecular masses between 21 and 540 {kDa.} The
	results clearly indicated that the diffusivity of the various proteins
	is a decreasing function of their hydrodynamic radius. This decrease
	is more rapid with globular proteins than with {FITC-labeled} dextrans
	{(Arrio-Dupont} et al., 1996, Biophys. J. 70:2327-2332), most likely
	because, unlike globular proteins, dextrans are randomly coiled macromolecules
	with a flexible structure. These data do not exclude the possibility
	of a rapid diffusion over a short distance, unobservable with our
	experimental set-up, which would take place within the first milliseconds
	after bleaching and would correspond to the diffusion in restricted
	domains followed by impeded diffusion provoked by the network of
	microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. Thus our
	results may complement rather than contradict those of Verkman and
	collaborators {(Seksek} et al., 1997, J. Cell Biol. 138:1-12). The
	biological consequence of the size-dependent restriction of the mobility
	of proteins in the cell cytoplasm is that the formation of intracellular
	complexes with other proteins considerably reduces their mobility.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	small and macromolecule-size solutes. We investigated quantitatively
	one important consequence of molecular crowding—reduced diffusion
	of biologically important solutes. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
	{(FCS)} was used to measure the diffusion of a series of fluorescent
	small solutes and macromolecules. In water, diffusion coefficients
	{(D)} were (in cm2/s × 10−8): rhodamine green (270), albumin
	(52), dextrans (75, 10 {kDa;} 10, 500 {kDa)}, double-stranded
	{DNAs} (96, 20 bp; 10, 1 kb; 3.4, 4.5 kb) and polystyrene nanospheres
	(5.4, 20 nm diameter; 2.3, 100 nm). Aqueous-phase diffusion {(Dw)}
	in solutions crowded with Ficoll-70 (0–60 wt\%) was reduced by
	up to 650-fold in an exponential manner: Dw = D exp {(-[C]/[C]exp)},
	where {[C]exp} is the concentration (in wt\%) of crowding agent reducing
	D by 63\%. {FCS} data for all solutes and Ficoll-70 concentrations
	fitted well to a model of single-component, simple (non-anomalous)
	diffusion. Interestingly {[C]exp} were nearly identical (11±2 wt\%,
	{SD)} for diffusion of the very different types of macromolecules
	in Ficoll-70 solutions. However, {[C]exp} was dependent on the nature
	of the crowding agent: for example, {[C]exp} for diffusion of rhodamine
	green was 30 wt\% for glycerol and 16 wt\% for 500 {kDa} dextran.
	Our results indicate that molecular crowding can greatly reduce aqueous-phase
	diffusion of biologically important macromolecules, and demonstrate
	a previously unrecognized insensitivity of crowding effects on the
	size and characteristics of the diffusing species. Copyright © 2004

	{(NCX)} and ryanodine receptors {(RyRs)} in rat ventricular myocytes.
	Transverse and longitudinal optical sectioning shows that {NCX} is
	distributed widely along the transverse and longitudinal tubular
	system (t-system). The {NCX} labeling consisted of both punctate
	and distributed components, which partially colocalize with {RyRs}
	(27\%). Surface membrane labeling showed a similar pattern but the
	fraction of {RyR} clusters containing {NCX} label was decreased and
	no nonpunctate labeling was observed. Sixteen percent of {RyRs} were
	not colocalized with the t-system and 1.6\% of {RyRs} were found
	on longitudinal elements of the t-system. The surface distribution
	of {RyR} labeling was not generally consistent with circular patches
	of {RyRs.} This suggests that previous estimates for the number of
	{RyRs} in a junction (based on circular close-packed arrays) need
	to be revised. The observed distribution of caveolin-3 labeling was
	consistent with its exclusion from {RyR} clusters. Distance maps
	for all colocalization pairs were calculated to give the distance
	between centroids of punctate labeling and edges for distributed
	components. The possible roles for punctate {NCX} labeling are discussed.},

	along sarcomeres at M-lines and Z-discs and co-localization is required
	for normal flight. We have extended our analysis of this phenomenon
	to include a set of six glycolytic enzymes that catalyze consecutive
	reactions along the glycolytic pathway: aldolase, glycerol-3-phosphate
	dehydrogenase (GPDH), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),
	triose phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase and phosphoglycerol
	mutase (PGLYM). Each of these enzymes has an identical pattern of
	localization. In mutants null for GPDH, localization of none of the
	other enzymes occurs and therefore is interdependent. In optimally
	fixed preparations of myofibrils, accumulation of the enzymes at
	M-lines is much greater than at Z-discs. However, localization at
	M-lines is more labile, as shown by loss of localization when fixation
	is delayed. We have begun to analyze the protein-protein interaction
	involved in glycolytic enzyme co-localization using the yeast two-hybrid
	system. We have identified two pair-wise interactions. One is between
	GPDH and GAPDH and another is between GPDH and PGLYM.},
