%\caption{Diffusion constants (D$_{TR}$ and D$_L$ in transverse and
%  longitudinal directions, respectively) obtained from raster image
%  correlation spectroscopy at 26$^\circ$C. Listed values were
%  obtained in water, measurement solution (solution), or \ac{CM} s. On the
%  basis of $n$ experiments, several parameters were determined in
%  addition to diffusion coefficient(s): concentration, triplet time
%  constant $\tau$ and triplet state contribution $T$. Correlations
%  between fluctuation of fluorescence signal were fitted by isotropic
%  model (diffusion coefficient specified only as D$_{TR}$),
%  anisotropic model (D$_{TR}$ and D$_L$ specified), or model with two
%  components (Cmp). }
